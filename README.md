# MidiMapper Korg NanoKONTROL2
A Processing sketch for building a virtual [Korg nanoKONTROL2](http://www.korg.com/de/products/computergear/nanokontrol2/) Midi controller.

I would like to build a virtual copy of a Midi controller. This way I could use the virtual controller when I don't have the actual Midi controller with me.

I use the java code written by Andreas Schlegel for the cp5 library and want to develop it further with the aim to maybe make it ready for implementing it into the cp5 library.

Since I'm not familiar with writing java libraries for processing any help is really welcome!
