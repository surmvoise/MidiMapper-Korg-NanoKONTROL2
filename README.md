# MidiMapper Korg NanoKONTROL2
A Processing sketch for building a virtual [Korg nanoKONTROL2](http://www.korg.com/de/products/computergear/nanokontrol2/) Midi controller. The code should also allow to be used with a different Midi controller.

I would like to build a virtual copy of a Midi controller. This way I could use the virtual controller when I don't have the actual Midi controller with me.

I use the MidiMapper library by Andreas Schlegel but I'm not entirely sure if it's the best way. I'm considering using "The MidiBus" library too.

Any help is really welcome!
